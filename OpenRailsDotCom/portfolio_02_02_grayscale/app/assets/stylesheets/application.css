 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets, vendor/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at the bottom of the
 * compiled file so the styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS
 * files in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.

/* 

In order to avoid the override of your application style with the Active Admin one,
you can do one of these things:

1.) You can properly move the generated file active_admin.scss from app/assets/stylesheets
    to vendor/assets/stylesheets.

2.) You can remove all require_tree commands from your root level css files,
    where the active_admin.scss is in the tree.
